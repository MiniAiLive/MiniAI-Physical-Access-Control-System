model:                                               # mandatory. used to specify model specific information.
  name: MiniFASNetV2SE
  framework: onnxrt_qlinearops                       # mandatory. supported values are tensorflow, pytorch, pytorch_ipex, onnxrt_integer, onnxrt_qlinear or mxnet; allow new framework backend extension.

quantization:                                        # optional. tuning constraints on model-wise for advance user to reduce tuning space.
  approach: post_training_static_quant               # optional. default value is post_training_static_quant.
  op_wise: {
     'Gemm_37_MatMul': {
     'activation':  {'dtype': ['fp32']},
     'weight': {'dtype': ['fp32']}
     }
     }

evaluation:                                          # optional. required if user doesn't provide eval_func in neural_compressor.Quantization.
  accuracy:                                          # optional. required if user doesn't provide eval_func in neural_compressor.Quantization.
    metric:
      topk: 1                                        # built-in metrics are topk, map, f1, allow user to register new metric.

tuning:
  accuracy_criterion:
    relative:  0.86                                  # optional. default value is relative, other value is absolute. this example allows relative accuracy loss: 1%.
  exit_policy:
    timeout: 0                                       # optional. tuning timeout (seconds). default value is 0 which means early stop. combine with max_trials field to decide when to exit.
  random_seed: 9527                                  # optional. random seed for deterministic tuning.
